                <p>
                    Hello! My name is Ian Bruns, and I am a student developer currently living in Denver, CO.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    I took up programming as a hobby in work from home/quarantine, and found myself absorbed in the
                    subject
                    material. I then signed up for the software engineering program through Thinkful! because I want to
                    make
                    this a career, not just a hobby. If you want someone who is passionate about the subject material,
                    you
                    will find that in me
                </p>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    When not programming, you can usually find me spending time with friends and loved ones, working
                    out,
                    and honing a ping pong skill that I developed working in payroll for a major corporation. I'm also a
                    pop
                    culture trivia library, and can sit down and talk to you about music at all times in the day until
                    I am
                    blue in the face
                </p>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    As for what services I can offer, I can do website development using HTML/CSS/JavaScript.  I am also learning Nodejs and React to better help with development services
                </p>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    So stick around, pull up a chair, and if you like what you see and want to get to know more, please
                    do
                    not hesitate to reach out!

                <p>
                    I have always been the kind of person who is always learnings and always striving to better myself.
                    It's a habit I picked up doing stand up comedy and playing a few instruments. Part of the reason I
                    started this journey in the first place was because I wanted to learn something new. I think no
                    matter your age or skill, you can always learn and improve

                <p>
                    The first thing anyone, professional or personal references, will tell you is that I am a social
                    person and try to make lasting, personal connections with everyone I meet. Teamwork is important to
                    me, I want to be someone you know you can be in the trenches with

                    In me you will find someone who wants to work with you to provide you with something we can both be
                    proud of. I am someone who looks at challenges and gets excited with problem solving, and you will
                    witness that in all of the work I do.  I currently develop in JavaScript/HTML/CSS
