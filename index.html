                Hello! My name is Ian Bruns, and I am a student developer currenly living in Denver, CO.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <p>
                I took up programming as a hobby in work from home/quarantine, and found myself abosorbed in the subject
                material. I then signed up for the software engineering program through Thinkful! because I want to make
                this a career, not just a hobby. If you want someone who is passionate about the subject material, you
                will find that in me
            </p>
            <hr>
            <p>
                When not programming, you can usually find me spending time with friends and loved ones, working out,
                and honing a ping pong skill that I developed working in payroll for a major corporation. I'm also a pop
                culuture trivia library, and can sit down and talk to you about music at all times in the day until I am
                blue in the face
            </p>
            <hr>
            <p>
                So sick around, pull up a chair, and if you like what you see and want to get to know more, please do
                not hesitate to reach out!
